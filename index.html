        <h3>My Skills</h3>

        <h4>HTML & CSS</h4>
          <p>If you want a static website, I'm able to quickly code and deploy a site which will be beautiful in its simplicity and ease of use. I'm also able to work from Photoshop design comps.</p>

        <h4>WordPress</h4>
          <p>I can help you install and configure a basic Wordpress installation. I can also modify your chosen child theme's code to incorporate your branding with color, logos, and customized widgets. I am familiar with the Genesis framework, which is optimized for SEO. (Genesis is what my personal site runs on)</p>

        <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
          <p>Do you have a buch of data in spreadsheets and don't know what to do with it? Let me use my 18+ years of experience to convert that data into beautiful visualizations that will enable you to make the right decisions at the right time.</p>

        <h4>Writing and Editing</h4>
          <p>I'm an award-nominated writer and can write blog posts, press releases, newsletters, or just about anything else you can think of. I'm also happy to polish existing copy until it shines.</p>

        <h4>Languages and Frameworks</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Wordpress</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Django</li>
            <li>Git and GitHub</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>About Me</h4>
          <p>I live in the tiny state of Delaware with my husband and our two cats. My previous career was as a corporate data analyst, but I've made the decision to strike out on my own as a freelance coder, data analyst, and write/editor. I've been creating websites for over 20 years &amp; I'm excited about the freedom and flexibility that freelancing will bring to my life.</p>

          <p>In 2017 I was a finalist for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Fan_Writer" target="_blank">Best Fan Writer Hugo Award</a> and I usually speak at multiple fan-run conventions each year, including ConFusion and Readercon. I have a personal blog, <a href="https://www.pretty-terrible.com" target="_blank">Pretty Terrible</a>, where I write about books, pop culture, and whatever else strikes my fancy.</p>
